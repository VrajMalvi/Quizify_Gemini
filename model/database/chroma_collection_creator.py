        Task: Create a Chroma collection from the documents processed by the DocumentProcessor instance.
        
        Steps:
        1. Check if any documents have been processed by the DocumentProcessor instance. If not, display an error message using streamlit's error widget.
        
        2. Split the processed documents into text chunks suitable for embedding and indexing. Use the CharacterTextSplitter from Langchain to achieve this. You'll need to define a separator, chunk size, and chunk overlap.
        https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/
        
        3. Create a Chroma collection in memory with the text chunks obtained from step 2 and the embeddings model initialized in the class. Use the Chroma.from_documents method for this purpose.

        Instructions:
        - Begin by verifying that there are processed pages available. If not, inform the user that no documents are found.
        
        - If documents are available, proceed to split these documents into smaller text chunks. This operation prepares the documents for embedding and indexing. Look into using the CharacterTextSplitter with appropriate parameters (e.g., separator, chunk_size, chunk_overlap).
        
        - Next, with the prepared texts, create a new Chroma collection. This step involves using the embeddings model (self.embed_model) along with the texts to initialize the collection.
        
        - Finally, provide feedback to the user regarding the success or failure of the Chroma collection creation.
        
        Note: Ensure to replace placeholders like [Your code here] with actual implementation code as per the instructions above.
